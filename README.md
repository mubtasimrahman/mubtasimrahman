## üöÄ Projects That Got Me Hooked on Coding

### **üåç [Irreal Visuals](https://irrealvisuals.com) - Redefining Web Presence (2024-Present)**
Working with an international marketing agency, I developed their first flagship site to drive a **66% client acquisition increase**. The site blends performance and aesthetics, built with **React (TypeScript)**, and deployed via **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.

- **Highlight**: Integrated a headless CMS to streamline updates without touching code, allowing easy management for non-technical users.
- **Challenge**: Balancing highly custom designs with scalability. Each pixel and animation went through multiple iterations to get it just right. 
- **Learning**: The power of continuous integration when working with design feedback loops and the importance of **WAI accessibility standards**.

### **üí∞ [ShareWize](https://github.com/mubtasimrahman/Capstone-ShareWize) - Expense Sharing App (Capstone Project, 2023-2024)**
Part of a four-member team building **ShareWize**, an app to manage and track group expenses. The project was a deep dive into the **full stack** (Node.js, React, Redux), but more than that, it was an exercise in **team collaboration** and **agile development**.

- **Highlight**: Implementing **Google OAuth 2.0** for authentication and using **AWS RDS** to manage financial data securely.
- **Challenge**: Making sure the app was **intuitive** for non-tech-savvy users. We refined the UX through **user testing** and iterations.
- **Learning**: The importance of **communication** within teams‚Äîregular stand-ups and code reviews kept us on track and aligned.

### **üéÆ [Game Galaxy](https://mubtasimrahman.github.io/Game-Galaxy/) - E-commerce for Games (2023)**
An e-commerce platform for game lovers. **Game Galaxy** aggregates prices and details from millions of online games, making it easier for users to compare and purchase. 

- **Highlight**: **API Integration** with 3 databases, parsing massive amounts of JSON data to deliver real-time results.
- **Challenge**: Designing the UI to handle large datasets without overwhelming the user. 
- **Learning**: There‚Äôs beauty in the **details**‚Äîwhether it's making an API call more efficient or tweaking the UI for responsiveness.

### **üì° FTP Clone - Learning the Fundamentals of Networking (2023)**
A deep dive into the basics of networking, this project was all about learning how the internet really works. Built an FTP client-server app using **Python** and the **Sockets API**, transferring text files seamlessly.

- **Highlight**: Handling **concurrent connections** with multiple clients in real-time.
- **Challenge**: Understanding the nuances of **TCP/IP** and how networking protocols handle failures.
- **Learning**: The core principles of the internet aren‚Äôt just theory‚Äîthey‚Äôre the building blocks of modern communication.

## üí° The Way I Work

I code with one philosophy in mind: **clarity over complexity**. Whether it's a simple function or an entire API, I believe in writing code that's **easy to read, easy to debug**, and **easy to maintain**.

I also believe in the power of **iteration**. A project is never truly finished‚Äîthere's always a new feature to add, a bug to squash, or a UX improvement to make. As a developer, I'm constantly **experimenting**, learning new technologies, and refining my craft.
